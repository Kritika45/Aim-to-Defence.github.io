      <h2> Five days Selection Procedure</h2>
      <p class="kdiv">Brief about SSB<br> Service Selection Board (SSB) conducts interviews for the selection of
        candidates
        suitable for training to the post of commissioned officers across all three forces. It is a comprehensive 5-day
        process
        divided into two stages after which recommended candidates undergo medical examinations. All the instructions
        for the
        documents to be brought along and dress code, etc are in the call-up letter available on joinindianarmy.nic.in
        and
        candidates are expected to follow all the guidelines strictly. There is no language barrier as candidates may
        speak
        in Hindi/English or a mixture of both but not any other language.</p>
      <h4>Stage I : Screening Process</h4><br>
      <p class="kdiv">Dress Code : Formal Dress<br>

        All the candidates will report to the SSB Gate or railway stations as mentioned in call letter and after
        verification
        of documents will be allotted chest numbers . They will then be given breakfasts and taken for the testing .<br>

        First would be the Officer Intelligence Rating(OIR) Tests which comprise of two sets of question bank on verbal
        and non
        verbal reasoning. Earlier candidates had to write their responses , but nowadays OMR sheets are given to mark
        the
        responses. Every set has different number of questions and the time allotted also varies so listen very
        carefully to
        the instructors briefing before the test.<br>

        After that PPDT i.e Picture Perception and Description Test will start . This test takes place in two parts
        first the
        perception part and then the discussion .In first part candidates will be shown a picture (mostly blurry/hazy)
        for 30
        seconds then in the next one minute they will record their observations i.e number of characters, their gender,
        mood and
        the action taking place in the picture. Then four and a half minutes will be given to them to write a story
        revolving
        around their observations .<br>

        With completion of this test candidates are taken out of auditorium , have snacks and then sorted into groups as
        per
        their chest numbers . Then one by one groups are called for discussion test . here one minute will be allotted
        to each
        candidate to narrate his story and after that the group has to discuss and form a common story which will in
        turn be
        narrated by a candidate selected by the group. After discussion of all groups end results will be announced and
        shortlisted candidates will stay back for Stage -II testing while remaining candidates will be sent
        home.<br><br></p>

      <h4>Stage – II Testing</h4><br>
      <p class="kdiv">The stage II testing takes place over the next three days concluding with the conference on fifth
        day.<br>

        Day -2 : Psychology Test
        Dress Code : Formal Dress<br>

        This will comprise of four tests each followed immediately after the other as following:<br>

        Thematic Appreciation Test (TAT) : Candidates are supposed to write stories based on 11 pictures and a blank
        slide at the
        end(totalling to 12) shown to them in form of a slide show. They will be given four and a half minutes to write
        each story.
        Word Association Test (WAT) : Candidates are supposed to write sentences/phrases/related word as they feel
        suitable on 60 words
        with 15 seconds available to write the responses for each word .<br><br>
        <b>Situation Reaction Test</b> : Candidates are supposed to write reactions to 60 situations in a total allotted
        time of 30 minutes.<br>
        <b>Self Description Test (SDT)</b>: Candidates are supposed to write five paragraphs under the following
        headings:<br><br>
        What my Parent’s Think About Me/ Parent’s Opinion<br>
        What my Teacher’s Think About Me/ Teacher’s Opinion<br>
        What my Friend’s Think About Me/ Friend’s Opinion<br>
        What I think about Myself/My strengths / Self Opinion<br>
        What I want to improve about myself/ Improvements needed in self/ Weaknesses<br><br>
        Day-3 And Day -4 :<br> <b>Ground Testing Officer (GTO) Tests</b><br>
        Dress Code : All White (T-shirt, Shorts, Socks And Shoes)
        <br>
        The candidates are sorted into groups as per their chest number and then each group performs the followings 9
        tasks under
        supervision of the assessor i.e the GTO . Mostly six of these are conducted on day -3 and rest on day -4.
        Sometimes they are all
        conducted in same day with breaks in between.<br><br>

        <b>Group Discussions (GD) </b>: The GTO at first gives two topics for the first GD out og which the group
        chooses one and then the group
        members put forth their views . For the second GD the GTO gives a topic and then the same thing happens again.
        Here there is no
        need for the group to come to a conclusion .<br>
        <b>Group Planning Exercise (GPE) </b>: The GTO explains a situation where there are various problems using a map
        of the place. After
        this the candidates have to first write their solutions in 10 minutes using all their resources which includes
        their group too.
        Then group members discuss among themselves on a common plan to tackle the problems, which in turn is narrated
        by one of the group
        members.<br>
        <b>Group Obstacle Race / Snake Race</b>: One of the most fun tasks in the whole process all the groups compete
        in a race crossing four
        obstacles which include single ramp jump, 8 -shaped bars, 10 feet wall, double wall, spider web, and ends with a
        giant slide.
        The rules to be followed are red colour shouldn’t be touched either by snake or my man. The snake is to be held
        by at least
        three members while crossing obstacles and breaking a rule gets a time penalty imposed by the GTO.<br>
        Progressive Ground Task (PGT): This one is actually a ground task where there are 4 different obstacle course
        each increasing in
        difficulty level ahead. The group is expected to move ahead tackling these structures using their helping
        material which may
        include a rope, plank, balli, etc. and there is a load to be carried also. The group is expected to follow all
        the rules given by
        the GTO which include:<br><br>
        (a) Color Rule:<br>
        White means for both man and material<br>
        Blue means only for man<br>
        Red is out of bounds for all<br>
        (b) Ground is out of bound for all<br>

        (c) Rigidity Rule : Helping materials can’t be tied with each other but can be tied with the structures<br>

        (d) Rule Of Infinity : The start and end lines extend to infinity i.e can’t be crossed directly .<br>

        (e) Distance Rule : No distance greater than 4 feet can be jumped.<br><br>

        <b>Half Group Task</b> : Similar to PGT but the group is divided into two and there is only one obstacle to be
        tackled.<br>
        Lecturette: An individual task where the candidates are expected to pick a card and then choose one out of the
        four topics
        on it which are of various categories and then speak on it for three minutes addressing his group.<br>
        Individual Obstacles : The candidate is expected to cross all the 10 obstacles all giving different scores as
        would be indicated
        on them .The candidate may repeat the tasks but only after he has completed all the 10. Following are the ten
        tasks with their
        scores indicated in .<br>
        Jumping over a single ramp <br>
        Jump over Double Barrel <br>
        Balancing Beam <br>
        Screen Jump <br>
        Burma Bridge <br>
        Tarzan Swing <br>
        Double Platform Jump <br>
        Double Ditch <br>
        Commando Walk <br>
        Tiger Leap <br>
        <b>Task: An individual task candidates are called one by one in a random order by the GTO where he asks them
          several questions
          and then explains them a task similar to PGT. Then he asks the candidate for this task a commander to call two
          of his group
          members as subordinates to help him in clearing the obstacle.<br><br>
          Final Group Task : As the name suggests the whole group is again given one obstacle similar to PGT which they
          have to cross
          together.</b><br><br>
      </p>

        in waiting hall for their turn . In the conference room all the assessors sit together and discuss whether a
        candidate is suitable to be recommended based on his performance in all the tasks and if there is a doubt they
        further question him during the conference. The non doubt cases are asked almost the same questions which
